Find HOTAIR:
SELECT gene_name, chromosome, seq_region_start, seq_region_end, (seq_region_end-seq_region_start+1) AS size FROM gene WHERE gene_name = 'HOTAIR';
#+1 vb. positie 1-10 -> lijkt op lengte 9, maar is 10

Find lincRNA:
SELECT gene_name FROM gene WHERE chromosome = 14 and biotype = 'lincRNA' and status = "KNOWN" ORDER BY seq_region_start asc LIMIT 1;

Genes prostate cancer:
SELECT gene_name, description FROM gene WHERE description like '%prostate%cancer';

Genes from x-chromosome:

A mutation was found on chromosome 20, position 44002590. Which gene(s) have an overlap with this position
SELECT gene_name FROM gene WHERE chromosome = 20 and 44002590 between seq_region_start and seq_region_end;

Which chromosome has the second most genes?
SELECT chromosome, count(*) AS freq FROM gene GROUP BY chromosome ORDER BY freq desc LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

On which chromosome strand lie the most genes?
SELECT seq_region_strand, count(seq_region_strand) AS freq FROM gene GROUP BY seq_region_strand ORDER BY freq desc LIMIT 1;

What is the most common biotype for novel transcripts?
SELECT biotype, count(*) as freq FROM transcript WHERE status='novel' GROUP BY biotype ORDER BY freq desc LIMIT 1;

For each biotype with more than 10 known transcripts, give the lowest start position and the highest end position?
